# Ocelots are Cuter Add-on

Have you ever got disappointed when you found an amazingly adorable
animal in a jungle, but as soon as you tamed it the cutest thing
somehow morphed into a completely different creature?

*Hey, this isn't what I wanted!*

This is an MCPE resource pack which makes ocelots preserve their
texture even after you tamed them. Since it's only a resource pack you
can still get achievements with the add-on activated.


## Tested on
* MCPE v1.0.4.11


## How to build
1. Install the following tools:
 * GNU Autoconf
 * GNU Automake
 * GNU Make
 * Info-Zip [Zip](http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html)
2. Run `./Build`.
3. Now there should be `mcpe-ocelots-are-cuter-addon-*.mcpack` under
   `_build/data/`.
